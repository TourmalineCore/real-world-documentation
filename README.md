# To Do real-world project
We have prepared an example of the simplest project called "To Do". This repository includes links to all repositories where the services involved in this project are located.</br> 
The project is closed by authentication, access rights are delimited using a token that contains information about the user's role and his available capabilities in the system. This project contains all the necessary features that are needed for real projects.</br>
We hope this example will be useful to you for further development.
